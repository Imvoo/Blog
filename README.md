OsuUserScraper
==============

This is my implementation of a score retriever which will visit the Osu! website and retrieve my recently played games, presenting the results in a neat table format.
There is an implementation of MongoDB as the database and it uses Jade to layout the HTML page.

The main reason behind this project was for fun, as I wanted to see what I could do.
I also did it as I enjoyed playing this game and seeing stats come out of it.
